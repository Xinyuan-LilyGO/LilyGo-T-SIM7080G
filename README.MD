## News

- SIM7080G supports **NB-IoT** and **Cat-M** in global frequency bands, but does **not support 2G/3G/4G**. Please confirm that the SIM card used supports **NB-IoT** or **Cat-M** before use.
- The SIM card must be inserted first before starting the SIM7080. If the SIM card is inserted after the SIM7080 is turned on, the modem will not be able to detect the SIM card.

## 3️⃣ Tips

0. T-SIM7080 has two USB ports, the USB-C port is used to upload sketches and Serial output, and Micro-USB is used for SIM7080G firmware version upgrade
1. ⚠ SIM7080G cannot connect to cellular network and GPS positioning at the same time
2. Board integrated PMU (Power management chip), with short circuit and overload protection. By default,`PWRKEY`needs to be pressed for 6 seconds to turn off the board power supply, and press`PWRKEY`for 128 milliseconds to turn on the power supply. If you need to modify the power off pressing time, please refer to`MinimalPowersExample`
3. If the charging function is required, the`PMU` `TS Pin`detection function needs to be turned off. By default, there is no NTC sensor on the board, so the `TS Pin` detection needs to be disabled before the charging function can be used normally. If the`TS Pin`detection function is not turned off, the PMU charging indicator will flash after the battery is inserted, and charging will be disabled
4. The board `VSYS` is the internal 5V boost output of the PMU, which can only be output but not input. Please do not connect an external power supply load greater than `500mA`
5. The `DC5` power supply voltage can be adjusted, and the maximum output current should not exceed `1A`
6. `DC1` is the core power supply voltage, and the default output is `3.3V`. Please do not adjust the `DC1` voltage through software
7. When the sketch cannot be uploaded, please press and hold the `BOOT` button on the board, and then insert the USB. At this time, you should be able to see the port in the device manager of the computer, and then click Upload Sketch again
8. When the power supply channel of the `ESP32S3` is closed incorrectly, please insert USB, and then press and hold the `BOOT` button of the board, and then press and hold the `PWRKEY` button. At this time, the board enters the download mode, and the sketch can be uploaded normally
9. If the power supply of the board cannot be turned on when the battery is connected, please check that the mechanical switch beside the USB is turned to`ON`, and then press the board `PWR` for `2 seconds`. At this time, the board should start to work
10. The range of solar input voltage is `4.4~6V`. Please select an appropriate solar panel and set the maximum charging current as `500mA`
11. If the camera is not connected, all IO ports are available. If the camera is used, the board has only `GPIO45` and `GPIO46` is idle
12. `T-SIM7080G` uses `Octal SPI PSRAM`, so **GPIO35~GPIO37** is unavailable. Please do not use these IOs
13. ⚠ **Please understand the risks to be faced before changing the voltage of peripherals, otherwise do not try to change the voltage of cameras and other on-board devices, which may cause permanent damage**
14. ⚠ **Please do not turn off the BLDO1 power supply, otherwise ESP32S3 and SIM7080G cannot communicate normally**
15. Please check the [Operating Instructions](./docs/sim7080_update_firmware.md) for updating the built-in firmware of the modem. Generally, upgrading the firmware is not recommended
16. The board uses USB as the JTAG upload port. When printing serial port information on USB_CDC_ON_BOOT configuration needs to be turned on. 
If the port cannot be found when uploading the program or the USB has been used for other functions, the port does not appear. 
Please enter the upload mode manually. 
    1. Connect the board via the USB cable
    2. Press and hold the BOOT button , While still pressing the BOOT button, press RST
    3. Release the RST
    4. Release the BOOT button
    5. Upload sketch
17. If you encounter a problem that you cannot register a network, please refer to this [issue#100](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-T-SIM7080G/issues/100#issuecomment-2662392543)

* If you do not use a camera, you can freely allocate IO ports here. Assuming you need to allocate I2C, please use the display to call Wire and pass the required IO ports, such as
    ```c
    int sda = 13;  // You can also use other IO ports
    int scl = 21;  // You can also use other IO ports
    Wire.begin(sda,scl)
    ```

| SIM7080G                     | 3.5V    | 4.2V    | Custom adjustment, maximum 1A |

* It is recommended to use flat top 18650 batteries with a capacity of more than 2500mA

| Solar Voltage requirements | Minimum | Maximum | Charging Current |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| SIM7080G                   | 4.4V    | 6V      | 500mA            |

> \[!TIP]
>
> It is recommended to use a solar panel with an output voltage of 6V or 5V and a power of about 5-10W. Solar energy can only charge the battery. Without the battery, the panel cannot supply power.
> Please note that this is only a suggestion. It is not necessary to use a 5-10W solar panel. 1W is also acceptable.
> The size of the solar panel determines the current and speed of solar charging. Please note that depending on the environment,
> the sunshine time may not exceed one hour per day. At this time, if the solar panel is too small and the light is not sufficient, it cannot be charged.
